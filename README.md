# Problem Statement:
Content moderation, when conducted by human agents, often encountered challenges stemming from errors and misunderstandings of the global policy. This was primarily due to the subjective interpretation of content, which led to inconsistencies in moderation decisions.

# Solution:
I developed a dual-purpose AI model for automated content moderation and text analysis, leveraging the capabilities of BERT and Transformer models. This state-of-the-art model was showcased in an Accenture competition for M***. It is adept at identifying and highlighting content that may be deemed problematic. Furthermore, the model possesses the ability to answer intricate questions by comprehending the context. Notably, the tool offers support for content moderation in multiple languages. This innovation holds significant promise for automating large-scale moderation tasks, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of online platforms.
